# What we'll cover

1. What's a web app? How do they work?
2. Source control (using Git and Github)
3. Users, Sessions, Cookies, Requests, Responses etc.
4. Databases
5. Security
6. Wireframes, Specifications
7. File uploads
8. App deployment

# What's a web app?

From Wikipeida:

> In computing, a web application or web app is a clientâ€“server computer program which the client (including the user interface and client-side logic) runs in a web browser. Common web applications include webmail, online retail sales, and online auction.

# What's the difference between a web app and a website?

From Wikipeida:

> _The general distinction between a dynamic web page of any kind and a "web application" is unclear_. Web sites most likely to be referred to as "web applications" are those _which have similar functionality to a desktop software application_, or to a mobile app.

---

# So, what's a web app again?

We'll use the following definition from here on in:

> A web app is an application built using _web technologies_ that runs in a web browser. It allows _users_ access to application-specific _functionality_ which allows them to perform operations on information stored in a _database_.

__Example web apps__:

Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram, Google Docs

__Example websites__:

BBC News, Google.com

# Web technologies

### Client Side

* HTML & Javascript

### Server Side

* PHP & MySQL

> There are *lots* of server-side (back-end) languages and databases that we could use, but we'll stick to PHP and MySQL for the duration of the module. There are *some* options on the client-side (front-end), but they will always be transpiled in to HTML and Javascript so they can run in the browser.

---

# Web app users

* User accounts are required to log in and access (some / all) of the web app functionality
* User accounts allow multiple users to use the same app (i.e. access and run the same code)
* A particular users data is associated with their user account

---

# Web app functionality

Some examples:

* Editing documents
* Managing photos
* Creating posts, comments
* Uploading files (photos, images, audio, PDFs)

---

# Web app databases

* Store the content created by users
* Are 'relational' - i.e an item of data can be related to another (e.g. a 'Post' to the 'User' who created it)
* Allow us to perform queries against the data (e.g. 'Return all the posts by user x created in the last 7 days')

---

# How do web apps work?

* The front-end (client-side) part is downloaded and runs in the users browser
* A user registers or logs in to the app
* The app UI allows the user to manipulate data in the browser
* The data is submitted via forms (POST requests) or via an API (using Javascript / AJAX request) to the back-end (server-side) part of the app
* The data is then persisted, and the app UI is updated to display the new data
