# Update

## Where we should be

<ul class="checklist">
    <li class="green">We should be able to log in and log out</li>
    <li class="green">Login should query the 'users' table in the database</li>
    <li class="green">A user should have a 'profile' in the database</li>
    <li class="green">We should retrieve the user profile from the database when the user logs in</li>
</ul>

# Security

1. SSL Certificates
2. Hashing passwords
3. MySQL Injection
4. XSS Attacks

# SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)

Provides end-to-end encryption for data sent to / from a server (this is what is used when you visit a website using a https:// URL)

## Why use SSL?

SSL serves two main purposes:

* Verifying that you are talking directly to the server that you think you are talking to
* Ensuring that only the server can read what you send it and only you can read what it sends back

---

# SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)

## How does it work?

* A browser attempts to connect to a website (actually a web server) secured with SSL
* The browser requests that the web server identify itself
* The web server sends the browser a copy of its SSL certificate
* The browser checks the certificate is valid
* The web server sends back a digitally signed acknowledgement to start an SSL encrypted session
* Data is encrypted to / from the server from here on in

See https://robertheaton.com/2014/03/27/how-does-https-actually-work/ for more detail

# Hashing passwords

>  A hash is a unique value created from some data

* Storing passwords unhashed is bad!
* Gaining access to the database will give an attacker *all* of the user passwords in the system
* These passwords have probably been used on other websites
* We can use the PHP hash function to create a hash value from a password
* There are lots of hashing algorithms available (md5, sha1, sha256)
* MD5 and SHA1 should not be used for hashing passwords
* There are other methods / libraries available to hash / encrypt

---

# Hashing passwords (Continued)

```php
define('HASH_SALT', 'Alonglistofrandomcharacters');

function hash_password($password)
{
    $result = hash('sha256', $password . HASH_SALT)
    return $result;
}

```

```php
$password = hash_password('password');
echo $password;

> "3dd4decebbf438ad2169bddaaf78e6aefe291d58"
```

---

# Hashing passwords (continued)

```php
function find_user($username, $password)
{
    $query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='$username' " .
             "AND password='$password'";

    $result = db()->query($query);

    return $result->fetch();
}
```

---

# Hashing passwords (continued)

```php
function find_user($username, $password)
{
    // Hash the plain-text password
    $password = hash_password($password);

    $query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='$username' " .
             "AND password='$password'";

    $result = db()->query($query);

    return $result->fetch();
}
```

---

# MySQL Injection

* We should not trust user input!
* Putting user input directly in to database queries is bad
* We should use prepared queries instead to send the query and data seperately
* This stops MySQL trying to execute values as part of the query

---

# MySQL Injection (continued)

Current implementation (vunerable to SQL injection)

```php
function find_user($username, $password)
{
    $query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='$username' " .
             "AND password='$password'";

    $result = db()->query($query);

    return $result->fetch();
}
```

---

# MySQL Injection (continued)

New version using prepared queries

```php
function find_user($username, $password)
{
    // Prepare a query (the part that will be executed)
    $sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username=:username AND password=:password";
    $query = db()->prepare($sql);

    // Provide the data
    $query->execute([
        'username' => $username,
        'password' => $password
    ]);

    return $query->fetch();
}
```

# XSS Attacks

> XSS stands for 'Cross-site scripting'

* Allows executing code from external sources in our website
* Web app uses input from a user in the output it generates without validating or encoding it

---

# What's next

Update your code to use:

* Hashed passwords
* Prepared queries

Then start work on:

* User Posts (Create Posts, Show Posts)
* Escaping HTML / preventing XSS attacks
